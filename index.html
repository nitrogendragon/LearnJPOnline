                <h2>What is LearnJPOnline?</h2>
                <p>LearnJPOnline is a passion project to help myself study japanese more effectively. While initially it will be basic
                    much like this description, I plan to ramp it up progressively adding more categories and features as I progress. I hope that this site
                will be able to help myself and anyone else who finds it to gain the knowledge they desire and make potential trips Japan a more pleasant and enjoyable experience. </p>
